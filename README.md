# FROGS
Customizable RPG System

FROGS stands for Free-form Roleplaying Odd Game System, meaning it’s a set of rules that can be applied universally for roleplaying games and be freely modified according to the group’s needs or interests. Because of its goal of being generic, there will be rules that should be used to help structuring the story and the game and suggestions about how you could apply those in your campaign, already knowing that they can't be used on their own.
